<p>This is a selection of my old poems (and one from a good friend). More to come soon™.<br />
If you have some works of your own, feel free to hit me up, I’d be more than glad to see them :)</p>
<h1 id="some-that-i-like">Some that I like</h1>
<h2 id="clouds-were-not-shaped-for-us-to-glaze-at">Clouds were not shaped for us to glaze at</h2>
<pre><code>Clouds were not shaped for us to glaze at
Nor were the stars made for us to live by •
Dreams thought us that, and much more than that
They thought us to always question why.</code></pre>
<h2 id="worlds-apart-are-we-from-us">Worlds apart are we from us</h2>
<pre><code>Worlds apart are we from us
When time stops and forgets about its fuss -
Our hearts start blazing
As we lean in, stargazing

Through two universes vast,
Universes of the past,
Universes full of lust,
Full of dreams and lack of trust.

Lost and with many abstruse thought
I have found what I&#39;ve never sought
To find, or even to pretend
To have seen anything, but a dark descend

Behind, over and in between
There is darkness to be seen,
Behind the stars which fairly lit
The universe with warmth and wit.

In between there&#39;s only time
Which divides dark from sublime
But once it wakes, it wants to start -
And when time begins to move
The universes break apart.</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-does-the-heart-not-hum">What does the heart not hum</h2>
<pre><code>What does the heart not hum
In times when sweet, sweet rum
Is poured down the ashes
Which the soul slowly washes
And makes thy reverie run ?

And along joyful rigor
One&#39;s got to figure
The wakening of the pith
Which is loosening the wit
And the sense, with the sedated trigger

Of asking the godly figure
If the rumor is true:
That none can forget thee,
Nor that one can set you free
To wander and to spread the vigor
Of heavens&#39; long gone past -

Oh, your song will ever last
In the brightly glowing, tainted souls
Of the blue and red captured rows
Which sing the only song they know and trust -
Along the fiery beat of a long gone past.</code></pre>
<h2 id="nothing-is-quite">Nothing is quite</h2>
<pre><code>Nothing is quite the righteous lump of sinew of virtue
Grumbling against the licit madness which claims to be true.
Nothing is quite contemplating for and above ones’ health,
Trusting itself to heal the egos long lost and forgotten self&#39; -
Or to be able to ponder about this and that
And be able to wonder at a not so simple and flat
Branch of erratic and fluid as opposed to a fabric hunk
You will always and forever call thinking.</code></pre>
<h2 id="war-within-by-l.-kathy-henkel">War within (by L. Kathy Henkel)</h2>
<pre><code>Der Kämpfer zieht
Nun in den Krieg,
Bewaffnet, so wie man es sieht.
Drum fühlt er sich sehr nah dem Sieg.

Das Heer der Feindes ist sehr groß,
Er zieht hin jedoch getrost.
Sie zu besiegen ist sein Ziel
Und maybe it is nicht only about the kill.

Maybe it isn’t about winning or loosing
Maybe it’s really more about the need of soothing;
Soothing of his troubled soul -
So off he goes, towards that which growl.

Maybe this is not what it may seem,
Maybe it is all but a dream,
Waking up wouldn’t be a sin -
Maybe it would help him win
The war within.</code></pre>
<h2 id="eine-harmonischer-rabatz---prolog">Eine harmonischer Rabatz - Prolog</h2>
<pre><code>Stumme Opfer schreien leis,
Taube Burschen hören aufmerksam zu,
Blinde Laien gestikulieren mit viel Fleiß,
Behinderte Hackler hintersinnen gewaltig dem Tabu,
Sorglose Nymphen beklagen ängstlich die Sitten,
Amputierte Troupiers stehen aufrecht, inmitten
Dieses harmonischen Rabatzes, erläuternd,
Und indessen auf den Irrtum der Menschheit hindeutend.</code></pre>
<h1 id="a-barbaric-tale">A Barbaric Tale</h1>
<h2 id="a-barbaric-tale---prologue">A Barbaric Tale - Prologue</h2>
<pre><code>Life is normal,
Death is common,
My brethren pray,
Animals stalk.

Men and women live alike,
Hebe enlightens all.
The birds humming in the night,
Cassiopeia watches over us.

People sing and dance,
Hunters meet,
Warriors prepare.
The leader wants to speak:

&quot;The fight is near,
Though sharing the same blood
Thou shalt not fear
The wolves hunting dogs.

&quot;Tribes grow, tribes settle, tribes fight
For the crow, for the cattle, for the might.&quot;
Silence, chuckle, cheer -
Life shining in the darkness.

&quot;For a war has begun.&quot;
We all embrace his sagely words.
Mead keeps mending unprepared souls
While gods plants blossom in our hearts.

The moon is brightly shining.
Beasts shadow wisely.
Ravens are gathering.
Skulls are waiting to be bashed.</code></pre>
<h2 id="a-barbaric-tale---chapter-i">A Barbaric Tale - Chapter I</h2>
<pre><code>At the fireside we hear stories
Of plunder, raids and glories,
Survival, loneliness and travel.
At the fireside, mysteries unravel.

There is one about our peoples,
The rise, the survival and the divide.
The story of the tribal
And what keeps us allied.

Once our tribe wanted to wander,
To find new lands, peoples and culture -
To preserve for the future
Wolves were sent to plunder.

And in plunder they&#39;ve found
Foreign golden godly grounds
Where promises of holy hounds
Turned wolves to dogs.

Wolf and hound
Once lived along
By shield were bound,
But dogs just growled.

We howled at the skies,
We howled for so long,
We howled for the night,
But dogs won&#39;t cry our song.

The moon is still shining.
Beasts remain wise.
Ravens are done gathering.
Skulls are waiting to be bashed.</code></pre>
<h2 id="a-barbaric-tale---chapter-ii">A Barbaric Tale - Chapter II</h2>
<pre><code>Hebe&#39;s rage
And Cassiopeia&#39;s cries
Flow through us
Following foreign lies.

Elderly wolves and cubs alike
Gather in alliance -
The forest shines in silence
While we prepare for a bloody fight.

The leader goes before us all.
The divined speak godly words.
The wolfs stamina, swiftness and control
Will defend ourselves from untrue swords.

With god&#39;s plants in our head,
Mead in our blood,
Our bodies and mind mend
And we shalt march against the false god.

We feel the glowing spirit,
Lightning crawling down our splines
As we leave the town and everything in it
As we swarm past our home lines.

Wolves stop briefly
Before moving swiftly.
Silence cutting all breaths,
All while dogs lay in their beds.

The moon guides our path
Unleashing the beasts within
Knowing how the ravens sing:
&quot;Let the skull bashing begin.&quot;</code></pre>

<h1 id="boundaries">Boundaries</h1>
<h2 id="part-i---prologue">Part I - Prologue</h2>
<pre><code>Forests are shimmering,
Nights are lingering,
Pounds are rejuvenating -
And the necromancers are resurrecting:

Zahhāk’s army,
Peri&#39;s brother,
Dragons hardly -
But even Pollux and Argus.

Xardas fights alongside Magnus -
Two wizards defeating legions -
Expecting people’s joy and penance
While fighting that which life threatens.

I hear a sound.
A distant tic-tac.
I turn around
Expecting a trap.

As I throw a glaze at the moon phase
The birds wonderfully hum until the thunder come.
As the mountains pass
I hold my gasp in the cloud of gas
Suddenly to get distracted
By the trees whose roots contracted.
Being here, I&#39;m astounded about the fact
Of slithering on the wandering, rocky, giant bat.

The world is bound
By a common tact.
I go over the closest mound
In the search of a map.

Of my deed I’m not proud:
Roaming through the skies of black
Feeling like a hound,
Swimming, trapped in an enclosed sack.

Fighting with Magnus, then with Xardas
Not knowing if I can win this allas.
Brooding birds bound to their being,
Spurred come and present their singing
While feelings inside me of undoubtful synergy
Synthesise thoughts storming in a symphony

With one question coming forth to mind:
Am I simply being blind ?
And one more for the questions&#39; sake:
Am I even awake ?

I am awake.
I’m awake ? I’m awake !
And have a pretty strange headache.
I feel alive, yet flat
With heavy eyes
Still remembering the lies
Told by the wandering, rocky, giant bat.

I may be just a dreamer
Shuffling through endless thoughts -
Knowing my soul is not becoming clearer
I escape in wonderful thinking-pods.

The bidding of my imagination
Wandering as it pleases
My life it simply squeezes,
Tempting endless contemplation.

The alarm rings,
I wake up,
My left arm stings,
I feel a gap.</code></pre>
<h2 id="part-ii---a-shore">Part II - A shore</h2>
<pre><code>My thoughts float on the sea I once called consciousness. Round the unconsciousness&#39; old tree I roam inside the boat of me. The ego is surplus and, as I notice, alas, to impede it&#39;s growing I begin rowing. I observe the meagre foliage, oh just the sheer knowledge; and I had frowned when I realized they were lonely bits of that which I had once known.

I row and row and row and stop;- I keep hearing a knock, knock, knock which drives me crazy and curious about the echoes crying in the distance. Again I row and row and row and see the source, which only grow, taking the form of two giant, ever growing, big, pink, naked hatchlings. They had just discovered that their own beaks, tarsus, toes and wings then looked at me quite uneducated with their heads tilted and slightly elevated and jilted me with a sincere stare for they have had only seen the blair they sit on since forever and the chaotic waves which keep the blair together.

Disappointed I leave my boat and go exploring with a dryness in my throat and a general numbness, because I do not know where I am truly going;- while breaking the boundaries set by my fears they slowly fade away as the gears of an once amazing machine reveal themselves to me alongside medicine. I presume the latter was for the inventor or artist to manage the former, yet both I gather. The parts are getting warmer as I build the forgotten wonder. The medicine … well, let’s say that I did not abide to my own ancient dogma and in the end the medicine got fewer and fewer the more I built.

The land looks dry and the hatchlings fly away all too shy from the unearthly machine. Oh how they spy and now low they lay from the overwhelming grey of the loud and obnoxious turbine. They wander off and linger soft on the high loft as the machine cites a scoff: `You are pink and I shall throw black ink for time will sink along the dreams and thoughts that fled with whims and knots in the sky of none.`</code></pre>
<h2 id="part-iii---from-thoughts-astray">Part III - From thoughts astray</h2>
<pre><code>Compromising a triad sleigh
Of symbiotic wings away
From the damned skies
And along dead and singing flies

Who illuminate all the true lies
Unicorns have spread
Through the world
From down low to the high north

And in between the time
Of then and now and the sublime
Moment I have met rhapsodies
Composed to express all themes

Human kind has and will ever
Feel before they go into the ether
Crystal-like stream which flows on the river
And awakes the living dead with a warm shiver

On their curved and still intact spline
While swimming along a levitating swine
Whose thoughts of dwindling
Of this little but not tiny thing

Which lays at your feet
And calls itself an elite
Emblem of human kind
And flies along the blind

And deaf and amputee
Fear you have of me.
What may this fear be?
Wild imagination should let you flee;

It should let you free
Into the tee wee
Wold around to see
All things created by you
Based around the few
Concepts which for them will never be true.

Let them live long
And remain gray -
Don&#39;t be wary
About the song
Of everything going astray
And forget about your worry;
Learn to be better, hence seldom sorry.</code></pre>
<h1 id="misc">Misc</h1>
<h2 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h2>
<pre><code>I feel like having the task
To just go around and ask -
Well, better said, myself inform -
What is wisdom ?

Is it something you can learn?
Is it something you can own?
Those questions are very firm,
But my interest has only grown.

Around I went, having a blast.
All questioned the questioning event
Nonetheless with good intent
But answered either too dull or too fast
And I had to go and read and myself ask:
What have people thought of it in the past ?

As I sat at home and read
What people like Aristotle or Socrates said
I’ve found some answers, and a few
Which I’d like to share with you.

The first was about humility,
Knowing what you know and what you don’t,
Recognising your true want
With humbleness and modesty.

The second was about accuracy,
Not only being down to reality.
Noone has to fight
If he truly knows if he is wrong or right.

The third one was under knowledge
And that isn’t only what your learn at your college.
It isn’t only having a grasp of the information at hand
But most importantly the ability to understand.

And the last was about rationality.
This one actually depends a bit on your personality.
It is the skill of being reasonable
To work with the logic of all things, even those not visible.

While wondering what wisdom stands for,
Sharing something I adore
I gave you my thoughts to read and explore
In hopes wisdom you’ll never ignore.</code></pre>
<h2 id="a-glimpse-of-the-underground">A glimpse of the underground</h2>
<pre><code>Traveling on the unknown
Lands long overthrown
By the surge and loss
Of a scorched overpass
Of all that&#39;s just
A territory you can&#39;t trust.

Here light and shadow merge -
A path of the highest verge -
But when your self submerge
The light is purged
The shadow purged
And the endless voids emerge.

From the follies you deem right
Nothing rises up to fight -
From the folly you call truth
You only see the arrogance of youth.
From the folly you call sense
You&#39;re left only with the dense
Cloudy and shattered lense
Whence followed by decadence.

Once you&#39;ve wondered for a while -
Gave up on light and fire,
Night and darkness, virtues too -
An elder shadow embraces you
And shows you the path that&#39;s true.

The way above and out is shown
By the lackey overthrown
And while he&#39;s showing you the path
You decide the aftermath.</code></pre>
<h2 id="to-the-day-on-we-march">To the day on we march</h2>
<pre><code>To the day on we march -
We, soulless creatures
Of different hurts and fevers -
To that day when the arch
Of all types, colors and features
Will be thrown in the ether
To make the path free
For us to simply be.</code></pre>
<h2 id="melancholic-love">Melancholic Love</h2>
<pre><code>We travel though the lands of greed,
Astonished by the ones we meet -
Somehow I can only feel the bore.
Just let us be no more.

The night is way too long
For it is without a song.
The day flies by so fast
But I hope it will come a time
When it will forever last.

Everything which isn&#39;t us
Needs to stay in the past
And when I&#39;m with you,
I know our love is true.

For we are
Who we are,
We will fight
And we will always be together.</code></pre>
<h2 id="my-valentine">My Valentine</h2>
<pre><code>On the fourteenth my dear,
Would you like to hear,
That you are my first and only choice,
Approve or not,
To sit in silence I cannot.
I&#39;d love to hear your voice.

Please touch me with your divine
And answer:
Would you like to be my valentine ?</code></pre>
<h2 id="waking-up">Waking up</h2>
<pre><code>A whisper of light
Shines from the forest
Beyond my sight
Beyond my jest
And beyond all life.

I see men lost in dreams -
None lost in thought -
Their human whims got sleepy
And only sleep they sought.</code></pre>
<h2 id="reminiscensce-of-habit">Reminiscensce of habit</h2>
<pre><code>I need pain •
I need some action •
I need relief •
A blank distraction.

And so I love •
And so I die
Before I know
Or answer why.</code></pre>
