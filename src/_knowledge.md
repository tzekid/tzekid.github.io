### eat once a day

- when having a stable routine (like uni and or work) eat once a day  
- otherwise, go to the gym, have a big meal and a big cup of coffee before starting your day  
- cheat: ([fatty](#WILT-fatty-coffee)) [coffee](#how_to-recipe) in the morning  

- work out before your main meal  
- eat as much as you have to eat in the day  
- take your time. 30-45 min cook. 60 - 90 min eat  
- go for a slow walk shorty after your meal

### avoid processed foods

- like sugar, alcohol or even sausages  
- cheat: have a tea spoon of honey in your morning coffee  
  It kept away sugar rushes in the beginning; became a habit  
- see: [WHY Sugar is as Bad as Alcohol (Fructose, The Liver Toxin)](https://youtu.be/f_4Q9Iv7_Ao)

### sleep more, sleep better

- try to achieve 8h of sleep a night
- go to bed and wake up at (mostly) the same time everyday
- take naps if you got less than 6h of sleep
- see: [WHY Sleep is critical for the Body and Brain | Science of Sleep](https://youtu.be/oTlJnyF3REs)

## Productivity

### 4 x 4 time management rule

- when no one is imposing a routine on you, break your time in four 4 hour blocks  
- work in 3 out of 4 blocks  
- block 3 out of the 4 hours of the work blocks towards working  
- the rest of time is for 'maintanance' like relaxing, working out, eating, etc.  

see: [Joseph Campbell's quote in The Heroes Journey](https://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/2008/12/joseph-campbell.html)

### use a calendar

- plan the upcoming day. use it as an ideal, rather than a fixed path  
- at the end of the day change the calendar entries to match reality  
- track everything except wasted time  

app: Google Calendar

see: [How Thomas Frank uses his GCalendar](https://youtu.be/KcWplarcZzY)  

### pomodoro technique

- aim for 4h of productive work a day  
- track your time and work habits (easy with the PCT app)  
- prepare your work environment before a session  
- at the end of the session, clean up, summarize and dump goals and ideas for the next session  
- respect your breaks  

see: [Productivity Challenge Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge&hl=en). This is the one that works for me. I love it.  

### when learning (or reading), do not highlight

- when highlight I personally always cheat myself into being more lazy or putting off understanding for later  
- read, look away from the material and think about what you've read  
- if you cannot think about what you've read, you didn't understand it  
- question what exactly you don't know or didn't understand before looking at the material  
- step away from the learning environment for a while if you cannot focus  

### use mnemonics

- connect any existing thoughts that pop up when thinking about the new piece of information  
- visualize facts or concepts. dream-like stories work best. the more absurd the better.  
- simply trying to find connections does wonders when it comes to retaining information  

### learn and study better by explaining

- you learn best when explaining something to others  
- a Dingding can be your best friend in such situations  
- revise everything you cannot explain plainly  
- ask questions about anything that isn't concrete  

### focus on as few things as possible

- don't have more than 6 consecutive items in your backlog  
- critically revise your lists and priorities  
- dump everything in lists. have systems in place that allow yourself to focus on the more important things  
- automatize everywhere and anything you can  

## Ethics

### take responsability

- take responsability for yourself, what's happening to you and your environment  
- don't blame others for something happening to you. you only have control over yourself  
- if someone is to blame do it quickly, be empathetic, focus on what's to be done in the future and how to handle the immediate situation.  

### be thankful

- many people along the way helped you get where you are  
- people doing a good job deserve at least an acknowledgement  
- acknowledging the small good deeds enriches your environment (see: take responsability)  

### (learn to) play the game

- no matter if it's a date or filling out papers, play the game  
- think about who's involved in the game, the rules and what's expected of you (ie. your role)  
- don't forget that the other players are people too. be empathetic  
- put yourself in their position. play the game well. you would be happy if someone made your life easier  
- taking a game seriously makes the players feel important. again, you would also like to feel important. take the game seriously  
- scrutinize your own thoughts and differentiate between not wanting to play a game and not believing in it. don't get involved in games you don't believe in.  

### belief and world views

- always be eager to learn about others' world view. ask questions and point out things that stand out, you will most likely learn something new  
- learn to formulate your world view briefly and concisely  
- many people are obnoxious because they don't know how express their beliefs in a more pleasant manner and are enthusiastic about their own view. be patient with such types  
- differentiate between someone obnoxiously presenting their beliefs and someone imposing them on you, or forcing you to adopt their beliefs  
- if someone is forcing their own beliefs on you, ie. forces you to act according to their beliefs, fight back or at least stand your ground  
- do not impose your world view on others  

### use hanlon's razor

- Never assume malice when stupidity will suffice.  
- Never assume stupidity when ignorance will suffice.  
- Never assume ignorance when forgivable error will suffice.  
- Never assume error when information you hadn't adequately accounted for will suffice.  
- Therefore, never assume malice when information you hadn't adequately accounted for will suffice.
