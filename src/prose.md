# Some that I like

## Clouds were not shaped for us to glaze at

    Clouds were not shaped for us to glaze at
    Nor were the stars made for us to live by •
    Dreams thought us that, and much more than that
    They thought us to always question why.

## Worlds apart are we from us

    Worlds apart are we from us
    When time stops and forgets about its fuss -
    Our hearts start blazing
    As we lean in, stargazing

    Through two universes vast,
    Universes of the past,
    Universes full of lust,
    Full of dreams and lack of trust.

    Lost and with many abstruse thought
    I have found what I've never sought
    To find, or even to pretend
    To have seen anything, but a dark descend

    Behind, over and in between
    There is darkness to be seen,
    Behind the stars which fairly lit
    The universe with warmth and wit.

    In between there's only time
    Which divides dark from sublime
    But once it wakes, it wants to start -
    And when time begins to move
    The universes break apart.

## What does the heart not hum

    What does the heart not hum
    In times when sweet, sweet rum
    Is poured down the ashes
    Which the soul slowly washes
    And makes thy reverie run ?

    And along joyful rigor
    One's got to figure
    The wakening of the pith
    Which is loosening the wit
    And the sense, with the sedated trigger

    Of asking the godly figure
    If the rumor is true:
    That none can forget thee,
    Nor that one can set you free
    To wander and to spread the vigor
    Of heavens' long gone past -

    Oh, your song will ever last
    In the brightly glowing, tainted souls
    Of the blue and red captured rows
    Which sing the only song they know and trust -
    Along the fiery beat of a long gone past.

## Nothing is quite

    Nothing is quite the righteous lump of sinew of virtue
    Grumbling against the licit madness which claims to be true.
    Nothing is quite contemplating for and above ones’ health,
    Trusting itself to heal the egos long lost and forgotten self' -
    Or to be able to ponder about this and that
    And be able to wonder at a not so simple and flat
    Branch of erratic and fluid as opposed to a fabric hunk
    You will always and forever call thinking.

## War within (by L. Kathy Henkel)

    Der Kämpfer zieht
    Nun in den Krieg,
    Bewaffnet, so wie man es sieht.
    Drum fühlt er sich sehr nah dem Sieg.

    Das Heer der Feindes ist sehr groß,
    Er zieht hin jedoch getrost.
    Sie zu besiegen ist sein Ziel
    Und maybe it is nicht only about the kill.

    Maybe it isn’t about winning or loosing
    Maybe it’s really more about the need of soothing;
    Soothing of his troubled soul -
    So off he goes, towards that which growl.

    Maybe this is not what it may seem,
    Maybe it is all but a dream,
    Waking up wouldn’t be a sin -
    Maybe it would help him win
    The war within.

## Eine harmonischer Rabatz - Prolog

    Stumme Opfer schreien leis,
    Taube Burschen hören aufmerksam zu,
    Blinde Laien gestikulieren mit viel Fleiß,
    Behinderte Hackler hintersinnen gewaltig dem Tabu,
    Sorglose Nymphen beklagen ängstlich die Sitten,
    Amputierte Troupiers stehen aufrecht, inmitten
    Dieses harmonischen Rabatzes, erläuternd,
    Und indessen auf den Irrtum der Menschheit hindeutend.

# Some newer ones

## A Stranger

    A want from me would come as rude
    A want from her'd be ridiculed •
    A flirty look is what it takes
    To catch her smile and gaze.

    As my station's coming by
    She delights me a "Goodbye" •
    Letting the scenery develope
    I'm left a heart of woe and hope.

# A Barbaric Tale

## A Barbaric Tale - Prologue

    Life is normal,
    Death is common,
    My brethren pray,
    Animals stalk.

    Men and women live alike,
    Hebe enlightens all.
    The birds humming in the night,
    Cassiopeia watches over us.

    People sing and dance,
    Hunters meet,
    Warriors prepare.
    The leader wants to speak:

    "The fight is near,
    Though sharing the same blood
    Thou shalt not fear
    The wolves hunting dogs.

    "Tribes grow, tribes settle, tribes fight
    For the crow, for the cattle, for the might."
    Silence, chuckle, cheer -
    Life shining in the darkness.

    "For a war has begun."
    We all embrace his sagely words.
    Mead keeps mending unprepared souls
    While gods plants blossom in our hearts.

    The moon is brightly shining.
    Beasts shadow wisely.
    Ravens are gathering.
    Skulls are waiting to be bashed.

## A Barbaric Tale - Chapter I

    At the fireside we hear stories
    Of plunder, raids and glories,
    Survival, loneliness and travel.
    At the fireside, mysteries unravel.

    There is one about our peoples,
    The rise, the survival and the divide.
    The story of the tribal
    And what keeps us allied.

    Once our tribe wanted to wander,
    To find new lands, peoples and culture -
    To preserve for the future
    Wolves were sent to plunder.

    And in plunder they've found
    Foreign golden godly grounds
    Where promises of holy hounds
    Turned wolves to dogs.

    Wolf and hound
    Once lived along
    By shield were bound,
    But dogs just growled.

    We howled at the skies,
    We howled for so long,
    We howled for the night,
    But dogs won't cry our song.

    The moon is still shining.
    Beasts remain wise.
    Ravens are done gathering.
    Skulls are waiting to be bashed.

## A Barbaric Tale - Chapter II

    Hebe's rage
    And Cassiopeia's cries
    Flow through us
    Following foreign lies.

    Elderly wolves and cubs alike
    Gather in alliance -
    The forest shines in silence
    While we prepare for a bloody fight.

    The leader goes before us all.
    The divined speak godly words.
    The wolfs stamina, swiftness and control
    Will defend ourselves from untrue swords.

    With god's plants in our head,
    Mead in our blood,
    Our bodies and mind mend
    And we shalt march against the false god.

    We feel the glowing spirit,
    Lightning crawling down our splines
    As we leave the town and everything in it
    As we swarm past our home lines.

    Wolves stop briefly
    Before moving swiftly.
    Silence cutting all breaths,
    All while dogs lay in their beds.

    The moon guides our path
    Unleashing the beasts within
    Knowing how the ravens sing:
    "Let the skull bashing begin."

# Boundaries

## Part I - Prologue

    Forests are shimmering,
    Nights are lingering,
    Pounds are rejuvenating -
    And the necromancers are resurrecting:

    Zahhāk’s army,
    Peri's brother,
    Dragons hardly -
    But even Pollux and Argus.

    Xardas fights alongside Magnus -
    Two wizards defeating legions -
    Expecting people’s joy and penance
    While fighting that which life threatens.

    I hear a sound.
    A distant tic-tac.
    I turn around
    Expecting a trap.

    As I throw a glaze at the moon phase
    The birds wonderfully hum until the thunder come.
    As the mountains pass
    I hold my gasp in the cloud of gas
    Suddenly to get distracted
    By the trees whose roots contracted.
    Being here, I'm astounded about the fact
    Of slithering on the wandering, rocky, giant bat.

    The world is bound
    By a common tact.
    I go over the closest mound
    In the search of a map.

    Of my deed I’m not proud:
    Roaming through the skies of black
    Feeling like a hound,
    Swimming, trapped in an enclosed sack.

    Fighting with Magnus, then with Xardas
    Not knowing if I can win this allas.
    Brooding birds bound to their being,
    Spurred come and present their singing
    While feelings inside me of undoubtful synergy
    Synthesise thoughts storming in a symphony

    With one question coming forth to mind:
    Am I simply being blind ?
    And one more for the questions' sake:
    Am I even awake ?

    I am awake.
    I’m awake ? I’m awake !
    And have a pretty strange headache.
    I feel alive, yet flat
    With heavy eyes
    Still remembering the lies
    Told by the wandering, rocky, giant bat.

    I may be just a dreamer
    Shuffling through endless thoughts -
    Knowing my soul is not becoming clearer
    I escape in wonderful thinking-pods.

    The bidding of my imagination
    Wandering as it pleases
    My life it simply squeezes,
    Tempting endless contemplation.

    The alarm rings,
    I wake up,
    My left arm stings,
    I feel a gap.

## Part II - A shore

    My thoughts float on the sea I once called consciousness. Round the unconsciousness' old tree I roam inside the boat of me. The ego is surplus and, as I notice, alas, to impede it's growing I begin rowing. I observe the meagre foliage, oh just the sheer knowledge; and I had frowned when I realized they were lonely bits of that which I had once known.

    I row and row and row and stop;- I keep hearing a knock, knock, knock which drives me crazy and curious about the echoes crying in the distance. Again I row and row and row and see the source, which only grow, taking the form of two giant, ever growing, big, pink, naked hatchlings. They had just discovered that their own beaks, tarsus, toes and wings then looked at me quite uneducated with their heads tilted and slightly elevated and jilted me with a sincere stare for they have had only seen the blair they sit on since forever and the chaotic waves which keep the blair together.

    Disappointed I leave my boat and go exploring with a dryness in my throat and a general numbness, because I do not know where I am truly going;- while breaking the boundaries set by my fears they slowly fade away as the gears of an once amazing machine reveal themselves to me alongside medicine. I presume the latter was for the inventor or artist to manage the former, yet both I gather. The parts are getting warmer as I build the forgotten wonder. The medicine … well, let’s say that I did not abide to my own ancient dogma and in the end the medicine got fewer and fewer the more I built.

    The land looks dry and the hatchlings fly away all too shy from the unearthly machine. Oh how they spy and now low they lay from the overwhelming grey of the loud and obnoxious turbine. They wander off and linger soft on the high loft as the machine cites a scoff: `You are pink and I shall throw black ink for time will sink along the dreams and thoughts that fled with whims and knots in the sky of none.`

## Part III - From thoughts astray

    Compromising a triad sleigh
    Of symbiotic wings away
    From the damned skies
    And along dead and singing flies

    Who illuminate all the true lies
    Unicorns have spread
    Through the world
    From down low to the high north

    And in between the time
    Of then and now and the sublime
    Moment I have met rhapsodies
    Composed to express all themes

    Human kind has and will ever
    Feel before they go into the ether
    Crystal-like stream which flows on the river
    And awakes the living dead with a warm shiver

    On their curved and still intact spline
    While swimming along a levitating swine
    Whose thoughts of dwindling
    Of this little but not tiny thing

    Which lays at your feet
    And calls itself an elite
    Emblem of human kind
    And flies along the blind

    And deaf and amputee
    Fear you have of me.
    What may this fear be?
    Wild imagination should let you flee;

    It should let you free
    Into the tee wee
    Wold around to see
    All things created by you
    Based around the few
    Concepts which for them will never be true.

    Let them live long
    And remain gray -
    Don't be wary
    About the song
    Of everything going astray
    And forget about your worry;
    Learn to be better, hence seldom sorry.

# Misc

## Wisdom

    I feel like having the task
    To just go around and ask -
    Well, better said, myself inform -
    What is wisdom ?

    Is it something you can learn?
    Is it something you can own?
    Those questions are very firm,
    But my interest has only grown.

    Around I went, having a blast.
    All questioned the questioning event
    Nonetheless with good intent
    But answered either too dull or too fast
    And I had to go and read and myself ask:
    What have people thought of it in the past ?

    As I sat at home and read
    What people like Aristotle or Socrates said
    I’ve found some answers, and a few
    Which I’d like to share with you.

    The first was about humility,
    Knowing what you know and what you don’t,
    Recognising your true want
    With humbleness and modesty.

    The second was about accuracy,
    Not only being down to reality.
    Noone has to fight
    If he truly knows if he is wrong or right.

    The third one was under knowledge
    And that isn’t only what your learn at your college.
    It isn’t only having a grasp of the information at hand
    But most importantly the ability to understand.

    And the last was about rationality.
    This one actually depends a bit on your personality.
    It is the skill of being reasonable
    To work with the logic of all things, even those not visible.

    While wondering what wisdom stands for,
    Sharing something I adore
    I gave you my thoughts to read and explore
    In hopes wisdom you’ll never ignore.

## A glimpse of the underground

    Traveling on the unknown
    Lands long overthrown
    By the surge and loss
    Of a scorched overpass
    Of all that's just
    A territory you can't trust.

    Here light and shadow merge -
    A path of the highest verge -
    But when your self submerge
    The light is purged
    The shadow purged
    And the endless voids emerge.

    From the follies you deem right
    Nothing rises up to fight -
    From the folly you call truth
    You only see the arrogance of youth.
    From the folly you call sense
    You're left only with the dense
    Cloudy and shattered lense
    Whence followed by decadence.

    Once you've wondered for a while -
    Gave up on light and fire,
    Night and darkness, virtues too -
    An elder shadow embraces you
    And shows you the path that's true.

    The way above and out is shown
    By the lackey overthrown
    And while he's showing you the path
    You decide the aftermath.

## To the day on we march

    To the day on we march -
    We, soulless creatures
    Of different hurts and fevers -
    To that day when the arch
    Of all types, colors and features
    Will be thrown in the ether
    To make the path free
    For us to simply be.

## Melancholic Love

    We travel though the lands of greed,
    Astonished by the ones we meet -
    Somehow I can only feel the bore.
    Just let us be no more.

    The night is way too long
    For it is without a song.
    The day flies by so fast
    But I hope it will come a time
    When it will forever last.

    Everything which isn't us
    Needs to stay in the past
    And when I'm with you,
    I know our love is true.

    For we are
    Who we are,
    We will fight
    And we will always be together.

## My Valentine

    On the fourteenth my dear,
    Would you like to hear,
    That you are my first and only choice,
    Approve or not,
    To sit in silence I cannot.
    I'd love to hear your voice.

    Please touch me with your divine
    And answer:
    Would you like to be my valentine ?

## Waking up

    A whisper of light
    Shines from the forest
    Beyond my sight
    Beyond my jest
    And beyond all life.

    I see men lost in dreams -
    None lost in thought -
    Their human whims got sleepy
    And only sleep they sought.

## Reminiscensce of habit

    I need pain •
    I need some action •
    I need relief •
    A blank distraction.

    And so I love •
    And so I die
    Before I know
    Or answer why.
