(From a conversation with) L. Kathy Henkel:  
To the thinking about the future: appealing to the path for which we were born (job, family, hobbies) is a given. My problem is that we, humans, do a very shitty job at thinking about the future in general. We don't have the cognitive models in order to do that proper which makes thinking about the future no different than thinking about the past or simply dreaming or fantasiz\[ing\] - although I'm pretty unfair: we differentiate between fantasy and what we perceive as our past, but you get the point. We have no mental model yet for thinking about the future proper. And that's pissing me off. The best I could find in the recent research is not that new at all: when thinking about the future, the brain activates a bunch of regions which are correlated with thinking about the past. We are dreaming the future in the terms of the past*. And my question is: can we do a better job than that? And if so, why is it impossible in the current state of human consciousness?  
*past experiences to be more precise, ergo the more you experience the better you can dream up the future.
