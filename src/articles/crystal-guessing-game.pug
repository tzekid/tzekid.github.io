        # Writing a guessing game in Crystal lang

        ## Introduction  
        
        I really wanted to write an introduction to crystal for some time now but didn't want to only write my take on the already well written [docs](https://crystal-lang.org/docs), so I thought I'd teach by example. <small>(ie. being heavily inspired by [Rust docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html))</small>  

        In this article I'll show you the basics of the [crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) language by building a simple guessing game. It will introduce you to core concepts like variables, error handling, loops and more !

        ## Set up
        For the instructions on installing crystal itself, just:  

        <input id="install" type="checkbox" /><label for="install"> go to the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/" target="_blank">official docs</a> and follow the instructions for your platform.</label>

        To set up a new project you'll have to `init`ialize it like so:
        ```bash
        λ crystal init app GuessingGame
        λ cd GuessingGame
        ```  
        
        The first command, `crystal init`, takes `app` as the first argument which creates an application skeleton with the second argument, `GuessingGame`, as the project name. 

        ## Processing a Guess
        Our main file is in `src/GussingGame.cr`. Ignore `require` and `module` for now; better yet, delete everything in the file and start from zero.

        The first part of the program will ask for user input, process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form.  
        ```ruby
        # src/GuessingGame.cr
        puts "Guess a number!"
        print "Please input your guess: "

        guess = gets

        puts "You guessed: #{guess}"
        ```  

        `puts` prints the output to the screen with an '\n' (newline) afterwards. `print` is like `puts` minus the newline. `gets` waits for the user input which is then assigned to the variable `guess`.  
        
        This line prints out the string we saved the user's input in. The syntax `#{}` is a placeholder that holds a value in place. You can print more than one value using `#{}`. Printing more than one value with `puts` would look like this:
        ```ruby
        x = 5
        y = 10

        puts "x = #{x} and y = #{y}" #> "x = 5 and y = 10"
        ```

        The `#` symbolizes the beginning of a comment. The comment will take up the rest of the line. As of yet there is no selective or multiline comment syntax in Crystal. In the future I'll use `#>` to show the output of a command. 
        
        <input id="assignment_strings" type="checkbox" /><label for="assignment_strings"> (optional) You can read more about [variable assignment](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/assignment.html) or more about [strings](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/literals/string.html) on the official docs.</label>  

        ### Testing the first part
        You can run the program so far like so:
        ```bash
        λ crystal src/GuessingGame.cr
        Guess a number!
        Please input your guess: 420
        You guessed: 420
        ```  
        At this point, the first part of the game is done: we’re getting input from the keyboard and then printing it.

        ## Generating a secret number  
        Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The secret number should be different every time so the game is fun to play more than once. Let's use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn't too difficult.

        Let's start using the built in `rand` function.   

        ```ruby
        # src/GuessingGame.cr
        puts "Guess a number!"

        secret_number = rand(100)
        puts "The secret number is: #{secret_number}"

        print "Please input your guess: "
        guess = gets

        puts "You guessed: #{guess}"
        ```  

        Generating a simple random number in Crystal is fairly easy with the help of the `rand` function. It takes an Int as the max range, so giving it 100 will generate numbers between 0 and 99.  

        <input id="rand_api" type="checkbox" /><label for="rand_api"> (optional) You can have a glance at the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/master/Random.html" target="_blank">Random</a> module on the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/master/" target="_blank">API docs</a>.</label>  

        It is always good to check the docs when you don't understand something, or when a StackOverflow answers get you only so far. At this point in time the documentation is extensive, but far from complete, and because the Crystal lang is written in itself, you can easily dive into the source code at any time to get a better understanding of the undelying concepts.  

        The second line that we added to the code prints the secret number. This is useful while we’re developing the program to be able to test it, but we’ll delete it from the final version. It’s not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon as it starts!  

        Try running the program a few times:
        ```bash
        λ cr src/GuessingGame.cr
        Guess a number!
        The secret number is: 30
        Please input your guess: 20
        You guessed: 20

        λ cr src/GuessingGame.cr
        Guess a number!
        The secret number is: 96
        Please input your guess: 92
        You guessed: 92
        ```  
        ## Comparing guesses  
        Now that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them:
        ```ruby
        # src/GuessingGame.cr
        puts "Guess a number!"

        secret_number = rand(100)
        puts "The secret number is: #{secret_number}"

        print "Please input your guess: "
        guess = gets

        puts "You guessed: #{guess}"

        if guess < secret_number
          puts "Too small!"
        elsif guess > secret_number
          puts "Too big!"
        else
          puts "You win!"
        end
        ```  
      
        Now, we could try using an `if, else` expression to compare our guesses.  

        <input id="if_and_co." type="checkbox" /><label for="if_and_co."> You can read more about <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/if.html" target="_blank">the <code>if</code> syntax</a> on the docs.</label>  
        
        But, if we try to compile the program we get errors:
        ```bash
        λ crystal src/GuessingGame.cr
        Error in src/GuessingGame.cr:11: undefined method '<' for Nil (compile-time type is (String | Nil))

        if guess < secret_number
                 ^

        Rerun with --error-trace to show a complete error trace.
        ```  
        That might seem very alien at first, but the Crystal compiler is here to help us. Crystal is a statically typed, compiled language. When we run the program from the terminal, Crystal more or less just compiles the program without any optimization flags for a quick feedback loop while writing the program.  
        
        ### Union Types and Error Handling  
        We don't say that guess should be a number, but the compiler infers the variable type from the `gets` function - because `gets` can be either a `String` when the user types in something or a `Nil` when he doesn't give any input, the Crystal compiler prepares itself for both outputs. `(String | Nil)` is called the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html" target="_blank">Union Type</a> of String and Nil.  

        The compiler warns us that `guess` can be a `Nil` at compile time, which would break the whole program and doesn't allow us to go any further until we fix it.  

        We just need to say, if the user gives an input then continue otherwise skip the whole code. We do that with something like so:  
        ```ruby
        # ...
        print "Please input your guess: "
        if guess = gets
          puts "You guessed: #{guess}"

          if guess < secret_number
            puts "Too small!"
          elsif guess > secret_number
            puts "Too big!"
          else
            puts "You win!"
          end
        end
        ```  

        ### Type inference
        By encapsulating `guess = gets` we ensure that when the `guess` is *not* `Nil`, the code block will run. If we tried to run the code, we'll run in another problem!
        ```bash
        λ cr src/GuessingGame.cr
        Error in src/GuessingGame.cr:10: no overload matches 'String#<' with type Int32
        Overloads are:
        - Comparable(T)#<(other : T)

          if guess < secret_number
        ```  

        This just means that the compiler expected a number (ie. an `Int`), but got a `String` instead. What we now need to do is convert the string to an integer; and another problem could arise from that too, namely users who do not enter valid numbers !  
        
        <input id="error_handling" type="checkbox" /><label for="error_handling"> (optional) Have a look at Crystals <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/type_inference.html" target="_blank">Type inference</a> and <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/exception_handling.html" target="_blank">Exception Handling</a> chapters.</label>  

        Converting an non-number string to an integer will raise an error - we will 'rescue' the error with an `begin..rescue` expression which is almost identical to eg. C#'s or Javas `try..catch`.  

        The code will now look something like so:
        ```ruby
        # ...
        begin
          guessed_number = guess.to_i
        rescue
          puts "ERROR: this String cannot be converted to Int: #{guess}"
          exit 1
        end

        puts "You guessed: #{guess}"

        if guessed_number < secret_number
          puts "Too small!"
        elsif guessed_number > secret_number
          # ...
        ```  

        The code should now compile. Try it out ! If the user doesn't enter a valid number, you can now see the error message we implemented.  

        ## Looping  
        The `loop` keyword gives us an infinite loop. Add that now to give users more chances at guessing the number:
        ```ruby
        # src/GuessingGame.cr
        puts "Guess a number!"

        secret_number = rand(100)
        puts "The secret number is: #{secret_number}"

        loop do
          print "Please input your guess: "
          if guess = gets
            begin
              guessed_number = guess.to_i
            rescue
              puts "ERROR: this String cannot be converted to Int: #{guess}"
              exit 1
            end

            puts "You guessed: #{guess}"

            if guessed_number < secret_number
              puts "Too small!"
            elsif guessed_number > secret_number
              puts "Too big!"
            else
              puts "You win!"
            end
          end
        end
        ```  

        As you can see, we've moved everything into a loop from the guess input prompt onward. Be sure to indent those lines and run the program again. Notice that there is a new problem because the program is doing exactly what we told it to do: ask for another guess forever! It doesn't seem like the user can quit!  

        The user could always halt the program by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-C`. But there's another way to escape this insatiable monster: if the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. The user can take advantage of that in order to quit, as shown here:
        ```bash
        λ crystal src/GuessingGame.cr
        Guess a number!
        The secret number is: 19
        Please input your guess: 42
        You guessed: 42
        Too big!
        Please input your guess: 19
        You guessed: 19
        You win!
        Please input your guess: quit
        You guessed: quit
        ERROR: this String cannot be converted to Int: quit
        ```  

        Typing `quit` actually quits the game, but so will any other non-number input. However, this is suboptimal to say the least. We want the game to automatically stop when the correct number is guessed.

        ### Quitting After a Correct Guess  
        Let's program the game to quit when the user wins by adding a `break`:
        ```ruby
        # src/GuessingGame.cr
        # ...
        if guessed_number < secret_number
          puts "Too small!"
        elsif guessed_number > secret_number
          puts "Too big!"
        else
          puts "You win!"
          break
        end
        # ...
        ```  

        By adding the `break` line after `You win!`, the program will exit the loop when the user guesses the secret number correctly. Exiting the loop also means exiting the program, because there are no more instructions to be run.  

        Not quiting if the user enters a string would make the whole experience more enjoying. For that, we could replace the `exit 1` from the `begin..rescue` expression with a `next`.  

        <input id="lhops" type="checkbox" /><label for="lhops"> (optional) You can read more about the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/control_expressions.html" target="_blank">Control expressions</a> from the docs. </label>  

        Now everything in the program should work as expected. Let's delete the `puts` that outputs the secret number, and try to actually `build` the program!
        ```bash
        λ crystal build src/GuessingGame.cr --release
        ```  

        `build` compiles and packs your code into a runnable executable. The `--release` flag tells the compiler to apply optimizations which will make the program much faster, but the code will take longer to compile. You now have an executable `GuessingGame` which you can run. Let's try running it:
        ```bash
        λ ./GuessingGame
        Guess a number!
        Please input your guess: 60
        You guessed: 60
        Too big!
        Please input your guess: two
        Please input your guess: three
        Please input your guess: 44
        You guessed: 44
        Too big!
        Please input your guess: 40
        You guessed: 40
        You win!
        ```  

        This is the final version of the code:  
        ```ruby
        # src/GuessingGame.cr
        puts "Guess a number!"

        secret_number = rand(100)
        # puts "The secret number is: #{secret_number}"

        loop do
          print "Please input your guess: "
          if guess = gets
            begin
              guessed_number = guess.to_i
            rescue
              # puts "ERROR: this String cannot be converted to Int: #{guess}"
              next
            end

            puts "You guessed: #{guess}"

            if guessed_number < secret_number
              puts "Too small!"
            elsif guessed_number > secret_number
              puts "Too big!"
            else
              puts "You win!"
              break
            end
          end
        end
        ```
