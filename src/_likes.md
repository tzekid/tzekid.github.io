## Music

It's a big part of my life. In 2017 I've started compiling monthly playlist, getting into the habit of exploring new music always. I've been inspired by [Nikita Voloboev](#) to create my own bliss playlist with all the songs I specially enjoy.

## Photographs

- what photography means to me  
- be more attentive to the world  
- a useful skill  

## Freedom

- don't like the path society and most corporations are taking  
- what freedom of speech and manifestation means to me  
- shaming and censorship have their places, but they can be misused. censorship is being misused right now  
- freedom as in taking responsability in your own hand and freeing yourself from being dependant on others. free from the master / slave mentality  

## Anger

- emotional intelligence done right  
- use the energy for something useful  
- I had to get my shit together before I could get angry/?
