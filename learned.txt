Lessons learned

(pre v2)
  • don't forget to enclose string variables in bash!
  • $ rename find_pattern replace_pattern *in_selection
  • bash it's all about piping. use read and the `|` as much as you can.
  don't be shy, and `echo`
  • I cannot get [ ! $some_false_variable ] working for an if inside an if for
  some mysterious reason. I've simply changed my approach. see: refine.sh
  • to avoid unnecessarily wasting buttloads of time (refactoring, for example)
  think through and plan a (complex) system you are going to implement before
  writing your first line of code
  • bash is all about streams and piping
  • entr(1) is awesome
  • wc exists. it counts stuff
